A comprehensive analysis of various responses shown by microorganisms found in snow sheets.

#  Snow Microstructure and microbial ubundance 
Dust particles are embedded toward the outside of snow grains and reside at the snow/pore interface. The microstructural analysis of the dust within the snow matrix suggests that a small portion of the dust particle surface is exposed to air, resulting in potential interactions between the dust particles and the microbes present in the pore space. Facilitation of these interactions could have important implications for activity and metabolism of snowpack microbes.

The microbial community composition variescwithin the snowpack, and the recently deposited dust layer harboring both the highest diversity and highest concentration of dust particles. The presence of microbiota in the dust-impacted snowpack has important implications for snowpack stability, melting, and biogeochemistry which in turn may lead to an avalanche.

Understanding of microbial location and activity combined with knowledge of how they contribute to melt would provide key data to more accurately project the stability of the snow pack and hence provide in advance an avalanche susceptible location.

# Diversity of microorganisms in snowpack 

Snow sheets have been found to contain a diverse range of microorganisms, including all major bacterial phylogenetic groups, such as cyanobacteria, as well as eukaryotic ribosomal RNA sequences. 

# NaCl stress

The snow alga Chlamydomonas nivalis responds to saline stresses. Salt levels determine the stability of snowpack, hence identifying and mapping such microorganisms can precise the prediction of an avalanche.
